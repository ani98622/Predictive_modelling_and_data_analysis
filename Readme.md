**Dataset** : Contains 8 features out of which 4 variables are categorical and 3 are numerical.<br> 1. Categorical : 'gender', 'race_ethnicity', 'parental_level_of_education', 'lunch', 'test_preparation_course' 
<br>
2. Numerical : 'math_score', 'reading_score', 'writing_score' 
<br> 
3 - Objective : To predict the Math Score by implementing the Modular Structure in which data has been ingested using 'SQL database'. Performed Data Transformation and 'Model Training'. Also, made modules for 'Exception' and 'Logging' to track the work 
<br> 4 - Method : Performed OneHotEncoding on categorical variables and StandardScaler on numerical variables. 
<br> 5 - Models : "Random Forest", "Decision Tree", "Gradient Boosting","Linear Regression", "XGBRegressor", "CatBoosting Regressor", "AdaBoost Regressor"
